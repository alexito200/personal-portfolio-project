  Home: this is the main page of my personal portfolio. It features a profile picture, my name, my specialization, and some icons with links (Github, LinkedIn, and X).

  Experience: on this page, I used the flexbox layout to create a clean-looking resume type of experience list. I made two columns and each one holds three jobs.

  Projects: for this page, I organized the projects into a three-box layout. I've added a hover effect on each box and clicking on them will take you to the project webpage.

  Contact: this page contains a simple form where the user can get in contact with me. The form request the user's name, email, and an optional message.
